## Features

This setup includes some utilities and examples to use as a foundation.

1. **Initial Interaction:** The user begins by entering their access code using the designated numpad on the web interface.

2. **Redirect to Scan Section:** Once the access code is entered, the system simulates a fingerprint scanner animation.

3. **Authentication Process:** 

   i) If the access code matches a registered user in the system's database, an "Access Allowed" window is displayed, granting the user access.

   ii) If the access code does not match any registered user, an "Access Denied" window is shown, preventing unauthorized access.
